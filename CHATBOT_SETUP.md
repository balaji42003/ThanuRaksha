## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Google Gemini API Key
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### 2. Configure API Key
Open `config/env.js` and replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:

```javascript
export const config = {
  GOOGLE_API_KEY: "your_actual_api_key_here",  // Replace this
  GEMINI_API_URL: "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent"
};
```

### 3. Alternative: Environment Variables (Recommended for Production)
For better security, create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Then update `config/env.js`:
```javascript
export const config = {
  GOOGLE_API_KEY: process.env.GOOGLE_API_KEY || "fallback_key_here",
  GEMINI_API_URL: "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest:generateContent"
};
```

### 4. Install Dependencies (if needed)
The app uses existing Expo dependencies. If you're missing any:

```bash
npm install @expo/vector-icons expo-linear-gradient expo-router
```

### 5. Run the App
```bash
npm start
# or
expo start
```
